cities:
- category_key = should connect to economic_categories, with the key corresponding to population centres
- name - city name
- key - name of the city without spaces
- id - id

economic categories - to store the containers (population centres, goods, etc)
- contents are self explainable by name i think

facilities - to store facilities in cities
- city_id = connects to id from cities, which city is the facility in
- facility key and name - name of facility
- production_method_key - connects to production_methods key column to connect the type of pm used

goods - it stores goods
- category key - to connect to economic_categories, key of goods
- subcategory_key - to connect to subcategories, key of subcat (example: connect to industrial_goods which has a category key for goods)
- name and key - name and key
- per kilogram price - read name
- yearly prod and consumption - in kg, the respective thing. to be only set by the dashboard calculation methods based off facilities and pms, not off user input

production methods
- category key - connect to econ categories key production method
- nam key - name and key
- input goods and output goods - what it says, in kg (for a fiscal year to match goods column). because there's no way to do an array in sqlite i've decided that it stores a csv-like format of ; separated blocks of "[good_key]:[amount]"
- expected employment - how much workers it needs. no sense in splitting it further because I dont think it would be worth trying to make the database model that and it would require doing the same thing as input-output

subcategories - it stores subcategories when needed (such as internal categories of goods)
